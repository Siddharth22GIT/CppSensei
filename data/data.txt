C++ is a general purpose programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C language.
C++ supports procedural programming, object oriented programming, and generic programming.
C++ is widely used in system programming, game development, embedded systems, and competitive programming.

A variable in C++ is a named memory location used to store data.
Common data types in C++ include int, float, double, char, and bool.
The size of an int is typically 4 bytes on most systems.

The const keyword is used to declare variables whose values cannot be changed.
The auto keyword allows the compiler to deduce the type of a variable automatically.

Operators in C++ include arithmetic, relational, logical, bitwise, assignment, and conditional operators.
Arithmetic operators perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus operations.

Control statements include if, else, switch, for, while, and do while.
The break statement terminates a loop or switch statement.
The continue statement skips the current iteration of a loop.

A function is a block of code that performs a specific task.
The main function is the entry point of a C++ program.
Function overloading allows multiple functions with the same name but different parameters.

An array is a collection of elements of the same data type stored in contiguous memory locations.
Array indexing in C++ starts from zero.
A multidimensional array is an array of arrays.

A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable.
The address-of operator is represented by the ampersand symbol.
The dereference operator is represented by the asterisk symbol.
A null pointer does not point to any valid memory location.

Dynamic memory allocation is performed using new and delete operators.
The new operator allocates memory on the heap.
The delete operator deallocates memory previously allocated with new.

A reference is an alias for an existing variable and must be initialized at declaration.
References cannot be reassigned after initialization.

A structure is a user defined data type that groups variables of different data types.
Members of a structure are accessed using the dot operator.

A class is a blueprint for creating objects.
An object is an instance of a class.
Access specifiers include public, private, and protected.

Encapsulation binds data and methods together and hides implementation details.
Abstraction exposes only essential features and hides complex implementation.
Inheritance allows a class to derive properties and methods from another class.
Polymorphism allows the same function to behave differently in different contexts.

A constructor is a special member function called when an object is created.
A destructor is a special member function called when an object is destroyed.
Constructors do not have a return type and have the same name as the class.

The this pointer holds the address of the current object.
Static data members are shared among all objects of a class.

A virtual function supports runtime polymorphism.
A base class pointer can point to a derived class object.

The Standard Template Library provides containers, algorithms, and iterators.
Common STL containers include vector, list, deque, stack, queue, priority_queue, set, map, and unordered_map.

A vector is a dynamic array that resizes automatically.
A list is a doubly linked list implementation.
A deque allows insertion and deletion at both ends.

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out principle.
Common stack operations include push, pop, top, and isEmpty.
A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In First Out principle.
Common queue operations include enqueue, dequeue, front, and rear.

A priority queue stores elements such that the highest priority element is removed first.
A circular queue connects the end of the queue back to the front.

A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are connected using pointers.
A singly linked list contains nodes with data and a pointer to the next node.
A doubly linked list contains pointers to both next and previous nodes.
A circular linked list connects the last node back to the first node.

A tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes and edges.
The root is the topmost node in a tree.
A binary tree is a tree where each node has at most two children.
A binary search tree stores elements such that left subtree values are smaller and right subtree values are larger.

Tree traversal methods include inorder, preorder, and postorder traversal.
A heap is a complete binary tree that satisfies the heap property.
A max heap stores the largest element at the root.
A min heap stores the smallest element at the root.

A graph is a collection of vertices and edges.
Graphs can be directed or undirected.
Graph traversal methods include breadth first search and depth first search.

Searching algorithms include linear search and binary search.
Sorting algorithms include bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort, and heap sort.

The time complexity of binary search is O(log n).
The time complexity of merge sort is O(n log n).

An iterator is an object used to traverse elements of a container.
The begin function returns an iterator to the first element.
The end function returns an iterator to one past the last element.

The string class stores sequences of characters.
The length of a string can be obtained using size or length functions.

Exception handling uses try, catch, and throw keywords.
An exception represents an error condition during program execution.

File handling is performed using ifstream, ofstream, and fstream classes.
The ifstream class reads from files.
The ofstream class writes to files.

Templates allow writing generic functions and classes.
A function template defines a generic function.
A class template defines a generic class.

Namespaces prevent name conflicts in large programs.
The std namespace contains standard library identifiers.

Inline functions reduce function call overhead by expanding code at the call site.
The mutable keyword allows modification of class members in const functions.

The sizeof operator returns the size of a variable or data type in bytes.
The typedef keyword creates an alias for an existing data type.

The volatile keyword indicates that a variable may change unexpectedly.
The friend keyword allows access to private members of a class.

Lambda expressions are anonymous functions introduced in C++11.
Smart pointers include unique_ptr, shared_ptr, and weak_ptr.
RAII ensures resource acquisition and release using object lifetime.

Move semantics transfers resources efficiently using move constructors.
The std::move function converts an lvalue into an rvalue reference.

The constexpr keyword evaluates expressions at compile time.
The nullptr keyword represents a null pointer constant.

Enum class provides scoped and strongly typed enumerations.
The using keyword creates type aliases and imports names.

The iostream library provides input and output using cin and cout.
The endl manipulator inserts a newline and flushes the output buffer.

The compilation process includes preprocessing, compilation, linking, and execution.
The linker combines object files and resolves references.

Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from multiple base classes.
Virtual inheritance avoids duplication in diamond inheritance problems.

A pure virtual function makes a class abstract.
An abstract class cannot be instantiated.

The static_cast operator performs compile time type conversion.
The dynamic_cast operator performs runtime type checking.

Const correctness prevents modification of data using const qualifiers.

The thread library provides multithreading support.
A mutex protects shared data from concurrent access.
The lock_guard class manages mutex locking automatically.

The chrono library measures time and durations.
The filesystem library performs file system operations.

Fast input output techniques improve competitive programming performance.
The ios_base::sync_with_stdio function disables synchronization with C IO for faster execution.
